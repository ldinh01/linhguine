            I am currently in my third year as a graphic design major here at MSU. I live in Mankato with my parents and two younger sisters, and we’ve lived in this same city our whole lives which is still pretty crazy to me. After I graduate, I hope to move to Minneapolis and possibly somewhere out of state eventually--wherever my career might take me.
            
            I was introduced to graphic design when I was really young, probably around 8 or 9. I spent a lot of time sitting behind a computer playing games and I was inspired by the art that I was seeing for these games. I was pretty computer savvy for a kid my age, and that led to my experimenting with a bunch of strange bootleg photoshop programs. It wasn’t until later in my highschool years that I discovered graphic design was a real career that people pursued.</div>

            Outside of school and graphic design, I love spending time on my other hobbies. Lately, I've been experimenting with digital drawing and painting with acrylics, watercolor, and pastels.
            I also love listening to music and have been playing violin since middle school. During quarantine, I picked up a love for cooking and trying new foods. A few of my favorites so far that I've made are tres leches or tiramisu. Although I'm still an amateur, I also love to sew new clothing pieces and embroider patches for myself and to use on gifts for people. When I have time, I also really enjoy playing games with my friends. After years of using a laptop, I finally upgraded and built my first computer setup that I'm really happy with!</div>

            Currently, I work as a student graphic designer for MSU. I count myself very fortunate for the fact that my education and outside hobbies both serve as inspiration for the other. Although I spend a lot of time being creative, I don’t usually feel burnt out because of how different each of my projects are. From music to embroidery, cooking, painting, or sewing, I always like finding something new to keep myself busy and inspired.
